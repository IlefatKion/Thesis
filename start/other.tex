\begin{dedication}

I dedicate this work to everyone that stood by me during my journey.
First of all, to my dearest parents \textbf{Souheil} and \textbf{Ameni}
whose love and guidance nurtured me and paved the way for me in every step
of my life. I never underestimated the sacrifices you did for our little 
family. This achievement, as well as others, is a coronation of 
your efforts. Beautiful days are coming!

To my brother \textbf{Manef}, the source of joy and happiness in our family. 
Thank you for being who you are, for loving and caring for me in your own way.

To all my family members that encourage me and celebrate me like a kid of their own.

To \textbf{Amine}, my support system since day one. Thank you for believeing in me
and pushing me beyond the limits. Our collaborations and ambitions shall continue.
Let's keep dreaming.

To my second family, \textbf{IEEE RAS INSAT}: the mentors and the work buddies.
I learned a lot from the experiences and from every one there and in particular 
through the \textbf{EUROBOT2023} experience. 

To all those who have supported and believed in me, both near and far. Thank you.

\begin{abstract}

      This thesis proposes a methodology for automated path planning for mobile robots in intralogistics 
      environments, taking into consideration environmental obstacles. The proposed path should optimally 
      connect the robot to a nearby target pose, while adhering to the robot’s kinematic constraints. The 
      path planning process should employ an online pattern-based approach, ensuring that the robot’s 
      behaviour is explainable, and all environmental recognition information is utilized during path planning. 
      The thesis aims to reduce the amount of information required for commissioning mobile robots, allowing for 
      broader use cases. The proposed solution will be implemented in the Robotics Application Construction Kit 
      (RACK) framework and evaluated for performance in real-time processing capabilities. The thesis consists 
      of literature review, design and development of the proposed solution, and validation through testing in 
      a simple test environment. The proposed methodology will enable mobile robots to navigate intralogistics 
      environments more efficiently and safely, contributing to increased productivity and dynamic logistics 
      processes.
