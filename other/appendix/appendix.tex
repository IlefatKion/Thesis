\section*{RACK: Robotics Application Construction Kit}

The RACK is a middleware for robotic applications that provides tools and libraries for developing these 
applications. It was developed by the University of Hannover and supports real-time requirements. The RACK 
offers advantages for large development teams through abstraction and standardization. It also simplifies 
communication between processes through standardized mechanisms. The RACK can be used in individual systems 
and distributed systems with real-time requirements \cite{R28}.

The RACK is based on real-time processes and drivers, and each functional component is called a module. 
Modules communicate through mailboxes using the publish-subscribe and client-server models. Each module 
has a command task and a data task, and the main task handles non-real-time initialization. The data 
processing tasks work with a data buffer that stores processed data. Modules are implemented in C++ \cite{R28}.
