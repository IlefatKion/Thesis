\section*{Introduction}

This chapter details the methodology and implementation of the proposed path planning system for logistics forklifts, 
focusing on guiding the robot to a pallet in the tight spaces of a warehouse. The system uses pattern-based paths with 
splines, optimized by meta-heuristic algorithms, to navigate efficiently in these confined areas. The chapter begins with 
an overview of the design structure, followed by a clear explanation of the algorithms and techniques used to ensure 
smooth and accurate movement toward the pallet. Implementation details are then covered, showing how the system 
components are integrated into a cohesive solution for precise pallet access within the warehouse environment.
