\chapter{Test and Validation of the Proposed Solution }

\renewcommand{\chaptername}{Chapter}

\section*{Introduction}
After the development conducted in the previous chapter, the results of the implementation 
and concrete tests are highlighted and discussed.
This part outlines:

* the initial conditions of the test: Coordiantes of the robot, and the coordinates of the station 
and its configuration and constraints. and the test scenarios.
* the results of path planning of the pattern path. 
* results of the evaluation approach 
* results of the path optimization
* Analysis of the Metaheuristics
* Comparison to OMPL
* the robot following the generated path. Screenshots of the robot at 3 intermediate positions and mention 
the coordinates. the robot in its final position.
